Arkos Player
------------
By Julien NÃ©vo (contact@julien-nevo.com)

Uses LHA Decompressor 0.9 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lhadecompressor/).

This code is for now only pre-alpha :
- Basic interface that can only play and pause.
- The replay routine is probably too slow.
- Most replay code is ok, but some tweakings must be done.
- Only the YM replay code is ready. SKS and AKS replay code isn't done yet.

Things will get better :).
